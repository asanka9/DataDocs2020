    Artificial Intelligence simply meaning is making its own decision without human interaction.
    Machine Learning and Deep Learning are a subset of Artificial Intelligence and the Final Goal of these are Making AI Application.

  <h1>Machine Learning</h1>

  <p>Machine Learning can be divide into 3 parts. Supervised ML, Unsupervised ML, Reinforcement ML are 3 types of ML.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Supervised ML</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Supervised Machine Learning can divide into two parts as
        Classification and Regression. In Supervised Learning, we have Labeled
         data ( as Input Data and Output Data ) if Output data has a continuous
         value this will belongs to the Regression case and otherwise, it belongs to Classification.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Unsupervised ML</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Unsupervised Learning not having labeled data clustering is a use case of unsupervised learning.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <li>Reinforcement ML</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We can call Reinforcement Learning as semi-supervised Learning. in childhood parents advise
        their children do this do not do this if you do this will harm your life
        but after childhood, they do not need advice they can understand by themself
        Reinforcement learning behave like this and that's why Reinfrorcement learning called as Semi-Supervised Learning
      </li>
    </ul>

  <p>How the human brain works with neurons, deep learning algorithms
    also works like this way. Deep Learning has neural networks as human nuerons</p>
  <p>Deep Learning divided into two parts as Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Supervised Learning</li>
    <ul>
      <li>In Supervised Learning Deep Learning has 3 techniques </li>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Artificial Nueral Network <strong>( ANN )</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Convolutional Nueral Network <strong>( CNN )</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Recurrent Nueral Network <strong>( RNN )</strong>

  <h1>Python Vs R</h1>
  <img class="img-fluid" width="500px" height="400px" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/js6C2mLXEDw/maxresdefault.jpg">
  <p>python and R are mostly use programming language in AI
    development and Data Science field. Both are open source programming
    language and easy to understand and implement</p>
  <p>In the Data Analytics field mostly use the R programming language,
    because R has more statics and EDA libraries with respect to python</p>
  <p>Machine Learning can implement both Python and R but in Deep- Learning R do
    not have many more libraries. Tensorflow is a deep learning library developed by
    Google and this will purely work with python. Pytorch is another Deep Learning
    Library developed by Facebook, PyTorch developed with OOP with Python. Also, cloud services such as Azure,
    Amazon - AWS use Linux as their OS. Python default install in Linux OS </p>
